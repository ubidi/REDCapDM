\title{Recalculate REDCap calculated fields}
\usage{
recalculate(data, dic, event_form = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame containing data from REDCap.}

\item{dic}{Data frame  containing the dictionary read from REDCap.}

\item{event_form}{Data frame  containing the correspondence of each event with each form.}
}
\description{
Function that recalculates every calculated field if the logic can be transcribed to R. Recall that calculated fields with smart-variables in the logic or variables in other events cannot be transcribed.

The function will return the dataset and dictionary with the added recalculated variables (the name of the calculated field + `_recalc`) along with a table that shows the summary of the results.
