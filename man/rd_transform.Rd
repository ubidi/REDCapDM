rd_transform(
  data,
  dic,
  event_path = NULL,
  checkbox_labels = c("No", "Yes"),
  exclude_to_factor = NULL,

  delete_vars = "_complete",

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Database containing data from REDCap.}

\item{dic}{Database containing the dictionary read from REDCap.}

\item{event_path}{Character string with the path name of the instrument mapping (can be downloaded in the `Designate Instruments for My Events` section of REDCap).}

\item{checkbox_labels}{Character vector with the names that will have the two options of every checkbox variable. Default is `c('No', 'Yes')`.}

\item{exclude_to_factor}{Character vector with the names of the variables that do not have to be transformed to factors.}

\item{keep_labels}{Logical indicating if the labels have to be kept or not.}

\item{delete_vars}{Character vector specifying the pattern that will contain variables to exclude. By default, variables ending up with `_complete` will be removed.}

\item{final_format}{Character string indicating the final arrangement format of the data that the function will return. Choose one of `raw`, `by_event` or `by_form`. `raw` (default) will return the transformed data with the original structure. `by_event` will return the transformed data as a nested data frame by event. `by_form` will return the transformed data as a nested data frame by form.}

\item{which_event}{Character string indicating if only one event has to be returned if the final format selected is `by_event`.}

\item{which_form}{Character string indicating if only one form has to be returned if the final format selected is `by_form`.}

\item{wide}{Logical indicating if the data split by form (if selected) has to be in a wide format or in a long one.}
}
\value{
List with the transformed dataset and dictionary.
